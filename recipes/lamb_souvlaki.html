        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Souvlaki is Greece's answer to street food and traditionally uses pork or chicken. Stuffed with slow-cooked meat, tzatziki, tomato and chips.</p>
            <p> Lamb <em>Souvlaki</em> with marinated pieces of lamb, threaded on skewers, and char-grilled to perfection. I like to serve these with rosemary garlic roasted potatoes, a Greek salad, and pita bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>⅓ cup olive oil</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons red wine vinegar</li>
                <li>1 ½ tablespoons chopped fresh oregano</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red wine vinegar, oregano, garlic, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl. Add cubed lamb and stir until lamb is coated with marinade. Cover and refrigerate 3 hours, or overnight.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Thread marinated lamb onto skewers, reserving any remaining marinade. Grill skewers until desired doneness, 10 to 12 minutes, basting with the reserved marinade and turning occasionally for even cooking.</li>
            </ol>
